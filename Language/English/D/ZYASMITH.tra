@0  = ~Welcome. What can I do for you?~
@1  = ~You're the blacksmith named Paul? Can you turn this crystal into powder?~
@2  = ~I'm sure I can do so. No problem. But it will take some time, so come back in two days. The price is 100 gold in advance.~
@3  = ~Here is the powder. That crystal was so hard I had difficulties to crack it, but I succeeded. Here you go.~
@4  = ~It's not finished yet. Don't be hasty, you will need to wait a little longer.~
@5  = ~All preparations are done!
